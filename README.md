A Terminal Client for Redis with AutoCompletion and Syntax Highlighting.

**This project is under development, any comments are welcome.**

## Features

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to clear cureent line, won't exit redis-cli. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>  
- Say "Goodbye!" to you when you exit!
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to open **reverse-i-search** to search through command history.
- iredis is smart, `CLUSTER NODES`, then `CLUSTER COUNT-FAILURE-REPORTS node-id`, iredis will do auto complete based on previous command.
- Command validation: `CLUSTER MEET IP PORT`
